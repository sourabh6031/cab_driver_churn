# 🚖 Cab Driver Churn Prediction

Predicting cab driver churn using machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) and deploying the model using Streamlit.

## 📌 Project Overview
Cab driver churn is a crucial problem for ride-hailing companies. This project predicts whether a cab driver is likely to churn based on various factors such as ratings, total business value, and joining designation.

## 🚀 Live Demo
🔗 https://cab-driver-churn-prediction.streamlit.app/

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains cab driver records with features:
- **Driver_id**: Unique identifier for each driver
- **MM-YYYY**: Month and year of record
- **Quarter_rating**: Driver rating recorded every 5 months
- **Total_Business_Value**: Revenue generated by the driver
- **Joining_Designation**: Role at the time of joining
- **is_rating_increased**: Flag indicating if the last rating is greater than the first
- **is_grade_increased**: Flag indicating if the driver’s grade improved

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- **Machine Learning** (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Model Training)
- **Streamlit** (Web App Deployment)
- **VS Code** (Development)

## 📊 Model Performance
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Random Forest | 82% | 84% | 90% |
| XGBoost | 78% | 80% | 91% |

*(Replace XX% with actual values)*

## 📌 Features Used in Model
- **is_rating_increased** (Most Important)
- **Total_Business_Value**
- **Joining_Designation**
